<h1>About</h1>
<p>
Once upon a time, most websites on the Internet were owned by the people. Humble individuals. Mom, pop, brother and sister. You and me. But that time is long gone. Today, most websites and publishing platforms lie in the fat claws of a few big corporations. 
</p>

<p>
When someone else controls your data, they have power over you. They can hold you hostage, control what you say and strangle your voice anytime what you say does not agree with their business agenda.
And so today, more than ever, our freedom is in danger.
</p>

<p>
That's why <b>secret campfire</b> was created on January 2019 to replace tumblr. Because as you've already noticed, there just aren't any good options out there. And we're tired of rolling the dice and investing in yet another <em>flavor-of-the-month</em> platform... only to have them betray us or crap out later.
</p>
  
<p>
With <b>secret campfire</b>, you can finally set up your forever home online. It belongs to you and you alone. No one can tell you what you can or can't do with it. And no one can shut you down.
</p>

<p>
<b>secret campfire</b> is an immortal personal microblogging system that...
