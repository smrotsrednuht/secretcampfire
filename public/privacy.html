  <h1>Privacy Notice</h1>
<p>
This privacy notice discloses the privacy practices for this website. This privacy notice applies solely to information collected by this website. It will notify you of the following:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>What personally identifiable information is collected from you through the website, how it is used and with whom it may be shared.
  <li>What choices are available to you regarding the use of your data.
  <li>The security procedures in place to protect the misuse of your information.
  <li>How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information.

<p>
<h2>Information collection, use, and sharing</h2>
We are the sole owners of the information collected on this site. We only have access to/collect information that you voluntarily give us via email or other direct contact from you. We will not sell or rent this information to anyone.
</p>

<p>
We will use your information to respond to you, regarding the reason you contacted us. We will not share your information with any third party outside of our organization, other than as necessary to fulfill your request, e.g. to ship an order.
</p>

<p>
Unless you ask us not to, we may contact you via email in the future to tell you about specials, new products or services, or changes to this privacy policy.
</p>

<p>
<h2>Other information we collect</h2>
We may collect other information that cannot be readily used to identify you, such as (for example) the domain name and IP address of your computer. We may use this information, individually or in the aggregate, for technical administration of our Web site(s); research and development; customer- and account administration; and to help us focus our marketing efforts more precisely.
</p>

<p>
<h2>External data storage sites</h2>
We may store your data on servers provided by third party hosting vendors with whom we have contracted.
</p>

<p>
<h2>Your privacy responsibilities</h2>
To help protect your privacy, be sure:

<ul>
  <li>not to share your user ID or password with anyone else;
  <li>to log off the this web site when you are finished;
  <li>to take customary precautions to guard against “malware” (viruses, Trojan horses, bots, etc.), for example by installing and updating suitable anti-virus software.
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<h2>Your access to and control over information</h2>
You may opt out of any future contacts from us at any time. You can do the following at any time by contacting us via the email address or phone number given on our website:

</ul>

<p>
<h2>Security</h2>
We take precautions to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and offline.
</p>

<p>
Wherever we collect sensitive information (such as credit card data), that information is encrypted and transmitted to us in a secure way. You can verify this by looking for a lock icon in the address bar and looking for "https" at the beginning of the address of the Web page.
</p>

<p>
While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect your information offline. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, billing or customer service) are granted access to personally identifiable information. The computers/servers in which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.
</p>

<p>
<h2>Cookies</h2> 
We use "cookies" on this site. A cookie is a piece of data stored on a site visitor's hard drive to help us improve your access to our site and identify repeat visitors to our site. For instance, when we use a cookie to identify you, you would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information on our site.
</p>

<p>
<h2>Information collected from children</h2>
You must be at least 18 years old to use this web site(s) and its service(s). This web site does not knowingly collect information from children under 13. (See the U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act.)
</p>

<p>
<h2>Disclosure of illegal activity</h2>
If you engage in any illegal activity, such as the submission of Child Pornography, we reserve the right to disclose any and all information deemed necessary to the appropriate authorities and/or the FBI and Interpol.
</p>

<p>
<h2>Changes to this privacy policy</h2>
We reserve the right to change this privacy policy as we deem necessary or appropriate because of legal compliance requirements or changes in our business practices. If you have provided us with an email address, we will endeavor to notify you, by email to that address, of any material change to how we will use personally identifiable information.
</p>

<p>
If you feel that we are not abiding by this privacy policy, you should contact us immediately via email.
